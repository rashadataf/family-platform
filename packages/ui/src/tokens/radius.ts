/**
 * The corner-radius scale (artboard 03).
 *
 * Spec 007 FR-006: this directory imports NOTHING — not React, not React
 * Native, not @fp/kernel. A future web client consumes these exact values, and
 * `token-layer-imports-nothing` in .dependency-cruiser.cjs makes that
 * structural rather than aspirational.
 *
 * The normative source is the design canvas: `design/tokens.json` beside the
 * artboards. `pnpm verify:design-tokens` fails when this file and that one
 * disagree, so a value is changed on the canvas first and here second.
